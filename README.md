# Column Number in Gutter

This VS Code extension shows the **current cursor column number** in the gutter next to the line number.

## Features
- Displays `Col X` beside the active line.
- Updates live as you move the cursor.

## Usage
1. Install the extension.
2. Open any file.
3. Move the cursor — the column number appears in the gutter.

## Known Limitations
- Only shows for the active line.
- Uses decoration overlay, not a true modification of the line number column.
